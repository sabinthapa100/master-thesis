# master-thesis

Collection of python notebooks and scripts that aims to provide a working translation from quantum optics formalism to open quantum systems formalism, notably master equations. This is achieved thanks to [QuTiP Library](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

The goal is to categorize which kind of states and Hamiltonians are better suited to maximaxe ergotropy. 

Eventually my final thesis will be also uploaded as we continue to work on these topics.

# TODO
- [x] Check ergotropy function, I suspect it is not correct
- [x] Check if analitical ergotropy and energy for T = 0 matches
- [x] Compare the two qubit case
- [ ] Change plots axes to match the article
- [ ] Probably there is something wrong in the calculation somewhere, debug!!
