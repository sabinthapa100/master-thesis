# master-thesis

Collection of python notebooks and scripts that aims to provide a working translation from quantum optics formalism to open quantum systems formalism, notably master equations. This is achieved thanks to [QuTiP Library](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

The goal is to categorize which kind of states and Hamiltonians are better suited to maximaxe ergotropy. 

Eventually my final thesis will be also uploaded as we continue to work on these topics.
