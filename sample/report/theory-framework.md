## Theory Framework

Here is a brief presentation of the concepts, figures of merits and physical
laws our thesis is based on. First I'll introduce ergotropy [2][3], then we'll touch
briefly on the experiment setup, and how we can describe it with an open quantum
system formalism[1]. Last but not least, we'll see how these two apparently
unrelated topics are brought together in our work, giving the reader all the
knowledge is needed to, hopefully, understand our results.
