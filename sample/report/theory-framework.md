# Theory framework

This chapter will review the concepts, figures of merits and physical laws our
thesis is based on. In the first section we'll introduce quantum batteries and
ergotropy, our main figure of merit [[1](#reference)][[2](#reference)]; the
second section deals with the preparation of the initial state and the charging
of the battery, introducing an experimental setup and how we can describe it
with an open quantum system formalism [[3](#reference)].

## Section I

### Quantum batteries

Quantum batteries are _d_-dimensional quantum systems with non-degenerative
energy levels from which work can be reversibly extracted. We can think of them
as miniature batteries, in which we store energy, and preserve it until needed,
exactly as a classical battery. We define _ergotropy_ as the maximal amount of
work that can be extracted from a QB via unitary operation.
The Hamiltonian of this system is $H_{0}$

$$H_0 = \sum_{j=1}^d \epsilon_j |j\rangle \langle j|,$$

with non-degenerate energy levels such that $\epsilon_j < \epsilon_{j+1}$, and
initial state described by the density operator $\rho$. The unitary evolution of
$\rho(t)$ is generated by the Hamiltonian $H(t) = H_{0} + V(t)$ according to the
equation

$$\dot{\rho}(t) = -i [H(t), \rho(t)],$$

with $\rho(0) = \rho$. The time dependence of $V(t)$ accounts for work
transfer and the work done on the QB is

$$dW = tr[\dot{\rho}(t) \dot{V}(t)] dt$$

whose solution at a certain time $\tau$ is

$$W = tr[\rho(\tau) H_{0}] - tr[\rho H_{0}].$$

Among all the possible states $\rho(\tau)$ reached under the action of $V(t)$,
we look for the one with the lowest possible energy $E_{f} = tr[\rho(\tau) H_{0}]$.
Since a solution of the dynamic equation is

$$\rho(t) = U(t) \rho U^{\dagger}(t)$$

where $U(t)$ is the time ordered exponential of the generator $H(t)$, we look
for a minimum of $E_{f} = tr[U(\tau) \rho U^{\dagger}(\tau) H_{0}]$ over all
unitary operators $U$

$$W_{max} = tr[\rho H_{0}] - \min_{U \in SU(d)} \{tr[U \rho U^{\dagger} H_{0}]\}.$$

By carrying out the minimization we find that
$\rho(\tau) = U(\tau) \rho U^{\dagger}(\tau)$
commutes with $H_{0}$ and has the same eigenvalues as
$\rho$. In the spectral resolutions,

$$
\rho = \sum_{k \geq 1} r_{k} |r_{k}\rangle \langle r_{k}|, \quad
H_0 = \sum_{j \geq 1} \epsilon_{j} |\epsilon_j\rangle \langle \epsilon_j|,
$$

we order the eigenvalues as

$$r_{1} \geq r_2 \geq \dots, \quad \epsilon_1 \leq \epsilon_2 \leq \dots,$$

and the minimum of $E_f$ is then $\sum_{j} r_k \epsilon_j$, and it is reached
for

$$\rho(\tau) = \sum_{k} r_k |\epsilon_k\rangle \langle \epsilon_k|.$$

Such a state is called _passive_ and no further work can be extracted from the
battery after time $\tau$ by means of $V(t)$. So, given an initial state $\rho$
the ergotropy $\varepsilon$ is defined, and calculated, as

$$\varepsilon(\rho) = tr[\rho H_{0}] - \sum_{j} r_k \epsilon_j$$

Note that we define ergotropy as a function of the initial state; in the next
section we'll introduce an experimental setup to prepare $\rho$. This process
can also be called _charging_.

- digression on the classical case? Gibbsian state and thermal work, and in
  which cases thermal work and ergotropy are the same
- why is the ordering important?

## Section II

### Interaction via quantum pulses of radiation

There are multiple ways to prepare the initial state of the QB, for example by
means of a laser. We choose the following setup, introduced by Kiilerich and
Molmer [[3](#reference)].

![experimental-setup](path)

Here, the system (our QB) is described, in the Born-Markov approximation, by
Hamiltonian $H_0$ and a set of $n$ dissipation operators $\{L_i\}_{i=1}^n$. The
evolution of its quantum state $\rho$ is obtained by the Lindblad master
equation

$$\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -i[H_0,\rho] +\sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{D}[L_i]\rho.$$

The system is coupled to an input bosonic field $b_{in}(t)$ by an interaction
potential

$$V(t) = i\sqrt\gamma[c b_{in}^\dagger(t) - c^\dagger b_{in}(t)],$$

where $c$ is the system lowering operator and $\gamma$ the decay rate of
excitations. Our quantum state input shall occupy a single normalized wave
packet $u(t)$; then the creation operator of the input field is described by

$$b_{u}^\dagger = \int dt u(t)b^\dagger(t).$$

Since it must be that $[b_u, b_{u}^\dagger] = \mathbb{I}$, we have the following
normalization for $u(t)$

$$\int dt \vert u(t) \vert ^2 = 1.$$

To avoid treating spatio-temporal propagation of quantum fields, we can think of
the wave packet $u(t)$ as emitted from a virtual one-sided cavity, coupled to
a continuum input fields $b_{in}(t)$ via interaction potential

$$V(t) = i[g^\star(t)ab_{in}^\dagger(t) - g(t)a^\dagger b_{in}(t)],$$

where $a$ is an operator of the virtual one-sided cavity and $g(t)$ the complex
coupling strength. Using the input output relation $b_{out}^\dagger(t) =
b_{in}^\dagger(t) + g(t)a^\dagger(t)$, we recover our previous definition of
$b_u^\dagger$ by choosing $b^\dagger(t) = b_{out}^\dagger(t)$. The virtual
one-sided cavity acts as a coherent beam-splitter between the discrete
intra-cavity modes and specific wave packet emanating from it. In particular,
if $g(t)$ is chosen as

$$g(t) = \frac{u^\star(t)}{\sqrt{1 - \int_0^t dt'\vert u(t') \vert ^2}}$$

the initial intracavity quantum state at $t=0$ is emitted as a traveling wave
packet given by $u(t)$. According to the theory of cascading quantum systems,
the time evolution of the joint state $\rho_{us}$ of the cavity with field
annihilation operator $a_{u}$ and the quantum system is described by a master
equation in Lindblad form, with Hamiltonian

$$
H_{us}(t) = H_{0}(t) + i\frac{\sqrt{\gamma}}{2}(g_{u}(t)a_u^\dagger c -
g_{u}^\star(t)a_u c^\dagger)
$$

and Lindblad term $\mathcal{D}[L_0^{us}(t)]$, with operator

$$L_0^{us}(t) = g_u^\star(t)a_{u}+\sqrt{\gamma}c,$$

in addition to the system jump operator.
Combining all the terms in the master equation, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\rho_{us}}{dt} &= -i[H_0,\rho_s] +\sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{D}[L_i]\rho_s \\
&+\sqrt{\gamma}[g_u^\star(t)(a_u\rho_{us}c^\dagger - a_u c^\dagger \rho_{us}) \\
&+g_u(t)(c\rho_{us}a_u^\dagger - \rho_{us}a_u^\dagger c)]\\
&+\mathcal{D}[\sqrt{\gamma}c]\rho_{us}+\mathcal{D}[g_u^\star(t)a_u]\rho_{us}.
\end{aligned}
$$
