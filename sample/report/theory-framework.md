# Theory Framework

Here is a brief presentation of the concepts, figures of merits and physical
laws our thesis is based on. First I'll introduce ergotropy [1][2], then we'll
touch briefly on the experiment setup, and how we can describe it with an open
quantum system formalism [3]. Last but not least, we'll see how these two
apparently unrelated topics are brought together in our work, giving the reader
all the knowledge is needed to, hopefully, understand our results.

## Quantum batteries

In order to introduce ergotropy we need to familiarize with the concept of
quantum batteries; from a formal point, _QBs_ are _d_-dimensional quantum
systems with non-degenerative energy levels from which work can be reversibly
extracted. We can think of them as miniature batteries, in which we store
energy, and preserve it until needed (exactly as a classical battery). Ergotropy
is the maximal amount of work that can be extracted from a QB via unitary
operation. But, how do we quantify ergotropy? Is it the same as the classical
thermal work that can be extracted from a classical battery? The answer to the
latter is no, and borrowing from [2] we'll see why.

### Thermal work extraction

Here we'll touch briefly the work extraction from a classical system, according
to the laws of thermodynamics.
