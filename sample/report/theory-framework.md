## Theory Framework

Here is a brief presentation of the concepts, figures of merits and physical
laws our thesis is based on. First I'll introduce ergotropy [1][2], then we'll touch
briefly on the experiment setup, and how we can describe it with an open quantum
system formalism [3]. Last but not least, we'll see how these two apparently
unrelated topics are brought together in our work, giving the reader all the
knowledge is needed to, hopefully, understand our results.

### Quantum batteries
In order to introduce ergotropy we need to familirize with the concept of
quantum batteries; from a formal point, *QBs* are *d*-dimensional quantum
systems with non-degenerative energy levels from which work can be reversibly
extracted. We can think of them as miniature batteries, in which we store
energy, and preserve it until needed (exactly as a classical battery). Ergotropy
is non other than the maximal amount of work that can be extracted from a QB via
unitary operation. But, how do we quantify ergotropy? Is it the same as the
classical thermal work that can be extracted from a classical battery? The
answer to the latter is no, and borrowing from [2] we'll see why.
#### Thermal work extraction
Here we'll touch briefly the work exraction from a classical systems, according
to the laws of thermodynamics.
