# Theory framework

This chapter will review the concepts, figures of merits and physical laws our
thesis is based on. In the first section we'll introduce quantum batteries and
ergotropy, our main figure of merit [1][2]; the second section deals with the
preparation of the initial state and the charging of the battery, introducing an
experimental setup and how we can describe it with an open quantum system
formalism [3].

## Section I

### Quantum batteries

Quantum batteries are _d_-dimensional quantum systems with non-degenerative
energy levels from which work can be reversibly extracted. We can think of them
as miniature batteries, in which we store energy, and preserve it until needed,
exactly as a classical battery. We define _ergotropy_ as the maximal amount of
work that can be extracted from a QB via unitary operation.
As stated above, a quantum battery is a _d_-dimesional system, with Hamiltonian
$H_{0}$

```
$$
H_{0} = \sum_{j=1}^{d} \epsilon_{j}|j><j|,
$$
```

with non-degenerate energy levels such that $\epsilon_j < \epsilon_{j+1}$, and
initial state described by the density operator $\rho$. The unitary evolution of
$\rho(t)$ is generated by the Hamiltonian $H(t) = H_{0} + V(t)$ according to the
equation

```
$$
\rho^{\dot}(t) = -i [H(t), \rho(t)],
$$
```

with $\rho(t=0) = \rho$. The time dependence of $V(t)$ accounts for work
transfer and the work done on the QB is

```
$$
dW = tr[\rho^{\dot}(t) V^{\dot}(t)] dt
$$
```

whose solution at a certain time $\tau$ is

```
$$
W = tr[\rho(\tau) H_{0}] - tr[\rho H_{0}].
$$
```

Among all the possible states $\rho(\tau)$ reached under the action of $V(t)$,
we look for the one with the lowest possible energy $E_{f} = tr[\rho(\tau) H_{0}]$.
Since a solution of the dynamic equation is

```
$$
\rho(t) = U(t) \rho U^{\dagger}(t)
$$
```

where $U(t)$ is the time ordered exponential of the generator $H(t)$, we look
for a minimum of $E_{f} = tr[U(\tau) \rho U^{\dagger}(\tau) H_{0}]$ over all
unitary operators $U$

```
$$
W_{max} = tr[\rho H_{0}] - min_{U \in SU(d)} \{tr[U \rho U^{\dagger} H_{0}]\}.
$$
```

By carrying out the minimization we find that $\rho(\tau) = U(\tau) \rho
U^{\dagger}(\tau) H_{0}$ commutes with $H$ and has the same eigenvalues as
$\rho$. In the spectral resolutions,

```
$$
\rho = \sum_{k \leq 1} r_{k} |r_{k}><r_{k}|,
H = \sum_{j \leq 1} \epsilon_{j} |\epsilon_j><\epsilon_j|,
$$
```

we order the eigenvalues as

```
$$
r_{1} \geq r_2 \geq \dots,
\epsilon_1 \leq \epsilon_2 \leq \dots,
$$
```

and the minimum of $E_f$ is then $\sum_{j} r_k \epsilon_j$, and it is reached
for

```
$$
\rho(\tau) = \sum_{k} r_k |\epsilon_k><\epsilon_k|.
$$
```

Such a state is called _passive_ and no further work can be extracted from the
battery after time $\tau$ by means of $V(t)$
